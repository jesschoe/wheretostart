# wheretostart



## Project Description

wheretostart is a React build utilizing Airtable where the user is able to vote for their recommendations to give those who are looking to break into a new movie genre, skill, or hobby an idea of where to start. This version focuses on sci-fi movies and users can recommend must-see movies for sci-fi beginners.

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP

- Display current top 10 recommended movies from Airtable API

- Form to submit new movie recommendation, retrieve movie's data from OMDB API, and post to Airtable API.
- Utilize React Router to link and display components
- Style using Tailwind and include responsive design

#### PostMVP

- Create a section for each movie where users can leave a review
- Create a carousel component so users can click through each movie in the top 10
- Create a section for another category (other movie genre, video games, coding, etc...)

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a good understanding of what i want my application to look like and what exactly I want it to do. As such, I can better plan for what needs to be done and how long it will take. I also know which labs and excercise I can reference if I get lost along the way.

### Weaknesses:

I am still not terribly clear on CRUD and how to make sure I can carry each aspect out for this project. Additionally, I prefer to stick to functional components but given the parameters of the project, I'll need to use class components, as well. I will likely use most of my research time/manager help on these matters.

### Opportunities:

This project is the culmination of the last 2 weeks and will give me an opportunity to solidify my understanding of react. I also happen to be interested in the function of my app given my interests, so I am motivated to make it look usable and attractive.

### Threats:

Whenever I get stuck with an error or an issue, I tend to go down a rabbit hole of online searches and debugging. Often times, I don't timebox these episodes and lose a lot of time. While this is typically a favorable characteristic in a developer, I'll need to make sure I know when to ask for help.
